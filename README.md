# What it does

This app keeps a list of words as you learn them. The list is stored on your device.

You start with an empty list. The list will grow each time you enter a new word, and will be removed when you uninstall the app.

The definition of words are retrieved from http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/

You can consider it a special browser for OALD with a lazy, and permanent cache.

# How to use

Start the app, enter a word, and click the Lookup button. Word definition will be downloaded at appropriate moment (with a max delay of 30 seconds) to conserve your battery.

When the word definition is ready to read, you'll get a notification.

You can also read again a word looked up previously by choosing it from the word list.

# Troubleshoot

If you don't get a notification for a new word, kill the app, and start it again.

# Future enhancements

Word definition view won't get updated until you close and open it again. Same problem with the word list. If you know how to implement the feature of updating UI on a background event, please show me. I'm a good learner :)
